## DEPRECATED
## NOTICE: End of work notice

Due to lack of time, support, and resources, the Coinpunk project is currently not under active development. See [the announcement](http://coinpunkblog.neocities.org).

Instead of using this code, I suggest building a new wallet based on our work improving the excellent new version of [BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib). Coinpunk was a product of it's time, and since then many improvements to the Bitcoin code ecosystem have happened.

Run your own Bitcoin wallet service.

Coinpunk is a web application that allows anyone to run their own self-hosted Bitcoin wallet service that is accessible from your web browser anywhere in the world. It's free, open source, and you can install it on your server right now.

## Who uses Coinpunk

Coinpunk is aimed at developers, power users, and sysadmins interested in running their own web-based Bitcoin wallet.

Coinpunk is also used to power [coinpunk.com](https://coinpunk.com), the first fully open source web-based wallet service.

## Highlights

The latest version is a major rewrite that uses hybrid-wallets: encryption is done in the browser via a client-side application, which can be run separately from the server. This makes it much harder for hackers to steal Bitcoins by breaking into servers.

**Coinpunk is in beta. It is set to testnet by default, and it is recommended that only developers and testers only use it at this time (especially in production).**

* Fast, lightweight, efficient
* Responsive design - works well on mobile devices
* Easily create new accounts
* Send and receive bitcoins
* Detailed reports on transactions
* Ability to create and name new receive addresses ("Website Donations", "Bake Sale", etc)
* Built with Node.js and HTML5
* Standards compliant, easy to upgrade - Uses bitcoind via the JSON RPC

## Get Started

See the [Install Guide](docs/INSTALL.md), 
or the [OSX Install Guide](docs/INSTALL-OSX.md).

## Coinpunk is for Advanced Users

If you've never worked on your own server before, and don't know how to do things like backup your database, I strongly recommend using a desktop client or hosted wallet provider like [coinpunk.com](https://coinpunk.com) instead. Coinpunk tries to be simple as possible, but like Gitlab, it does require a lot of knowledge to be run properly.

Also if you are planning on running Coinpunk on a VPS, you can [use this link to sign up for DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4be99ecc05b4) and it gives us a referral bonus we can use to pay for the servers.

Again, thank you. :heart:
